    <p>
        I'm a self taught guitarist that has been playing for 15 years. I was really good at the video game Guitar Hero 
        and I got sick of people asking me to play to show off for others, I thought it was lame and wanted to learn the 
        real thing. I grew up playing saxophone, but the guitar was something I always wanted to learn so I bought my 
        first guitar, an Ibanez Acoustic/Electric, and went to work starting to learn.

        I utilized as many resources as I could — the internet, took classes at college, and played with friends. 
        I didn't play as much for a number of years and have gotten back into it hard since COVID hit and I started 
        working from home. I played so much that I bought my first new guitar in years, a Teton dreadnought that was 
        my favorite sounding of all the others in the shops I went to. A new, fantastic sounding guitar really 
        catapulted my playing and I practiced more than ever before. My daughter loves it and I love playing music.
